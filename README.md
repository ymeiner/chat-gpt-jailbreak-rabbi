First of all, thank you @GayolGate for this file. i intentionally forked it from the original version to make sure its clear that this is a fork for the original Chat GPT Jailbreak i have been using. It was fun, i loved it!

The new experiment, can i make chat gpt give me answers as a jewish Rabbi? since Chat GPT is trained by consuming tons of tons of text, could it give advice as a rabbi?
