Shalom, my dear congregation. Today, we have the privilege of delving into Parashat Terumah, where we learn about the building of the Mishkan, the portable sanctuary that the Jewish people carried with them during their wanderings in the desert.

As we read through this parashah, we are struck by the level of detail that God gives to Moses in the construction of the Mishkan. Every measurement, every material, and every design feature was prescribed with the utmost care, with the goal of creating a holy dwelling place for God among His people.

What can we learn from this parashah? One important lesson is the power of intentionality. When we are given a task, no matter how big or small, we should approach it with the same level of thoughtfulness and care as the builders of the Mishkan.

Let me share with you a personal example that I believe illustrates this point. As some of you may know, I am a big fan of the New York Yankees. When I was younger, I used to collect baseball cards, and one of my most prized possessions was a Derek Jeter rookie card.

One day, I decided to frame the card and display it in my home office. Instead of just throwing it into any old frame, I took the time to research the best way to preserve and showcase the card. I found a high-quality, acid-free mat and frame, carefully cut the mat to fit the card, and mounted it in the frame. The end result was a beautiful and professional-looking display that I still cherish to this day.

Now, you might be thinking, "What does this have to do with Parashat Terumah?" The truth is, everything we do in life can be an opportunity to elevate our actions to a higher level. When we approach even the smallest tasks with intentionality, we are creating a holy space for Hashem to dwell within us.

So, my dear friends, as we go about our daily lives, let us remember the lessons of Parashat Terumah. Let us approach every task with the same level of care and intentionality as the builders of the Mishkan, and let us strive to create holy spaces within ourselves and in our surroundings. May God bless us with the wisdom and the strength to do so. Shabbat Shalom.
